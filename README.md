# SQLite3 Data Bases

I am trying to learn about databases and how they store and retrieve data. I decided a good place to start is with SQLite3 because it is built in to Python.

I decided to make a database that would store information about my family. Sort of a personal profile if you will. The database stores email addresses, birthdays, hobbies, and some interesting places they have traveled to. My family likes to travel so I thought it would be fun to compare where everyone has been in the world.  

I decided to write this software because I want to learn more about how databases work. I find it interesting how we can store so much information and retreive it in a matter of seconds. We use databases almost everyday when we are online so I thought why not learn about them. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

I am using SQLite 3 which is built into Python. I thought this would be a good starting place to learn about databases. 

I created three tables. One table to store names, email addresses, and birthdays. One table to store hobbies, and another for storing travel locations. I use the name as a unique key so that I can look up information based on a family members name. The tables are arranged in table names which act as sort of a key, columns and rows which are similar to how we normally interpret columns and rows. 

# Development Environment

I used Python in Visual Studio Code to develp my software. Python has a built in database called SQLite 3 which I imported to create my database.

# Useful Websites

Below are some websites I found useful when learning about SQLite3 databases.

* [YouTube SQLite tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA)

# Future Work

* Get the tables to print in an organized way.
* Join tables to make comparison easy.
* Make this sharable so my family members can input their information.
